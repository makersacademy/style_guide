# Ruby style guide 

Unless otherwise specified, we take our conventions from the [standard Ruby style guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide) - which also matches up with the Rubocop default. Exceptions or important rules worth highlighting are included below.

> All exceptions are covered using our [custom Rubocop file](.rubocop.yml) - use this when adding Rubocop to course repos

## Makers Conventions

* [Use double quotes](http://viget.com/extend/just-use-double-quoted-ruby-strings)
